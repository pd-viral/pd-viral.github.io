        <h1 class="font-weight-light">Corona is affecting everyone - from a global to a local level</h1>
        <p class="lead">The corona crisis is unfolding worldwide: States, municipalities, villages, and citizens are
          facing unprecedented, existential challenges. Corona is a global crisis, that does not stop at border
          checkpoints and has been deeply affecting our everyday live. No global crisis in modern history has been so
          closely monitored with data. The access to dashboards and other data visualizations show us almost in real
          time the cruel reality of a quickly spreading pandemic within a globalized world.</p>
        <p class="lead">
          At the same time, the huge quantity of data on this outbreak allows us to gain valuable insights on how to
          best tackle the negative consequences COVID-19 has on our lives. Scientists, politicians and civil society are
          coming closer to develop data-driven solutions. We want to contribute to this effort and have come together as
          individuals from diverse backgrounds and professions to join forces in analyzing the data available and
          identifying what we call the “positive deviants”.
        </p>

        <h1 class="font-weight-light">Identifying Positive Deviance: Local Solutions for Global Challenges</h1>
        <p class="lead">Positive Deviants are individuals, groups, cities, regions etc. who outperform their peers in a
          comparable context thanks to creative and highly adaptive solutions they have come up with. These solutions
          have proven to work in a specific context and offer as such a high potential to support their peers facing the
          same challenges. The Positive Deviance approach was first developed in the 1990s by Sternin and Sternin on
          child nutrition in Vietnam (<a
            href="https://books.google.de/books/about/The_Power_Of_Positive_Deviance.html?id=nBgDmcy9SnkC&redir_esc=y"
            target="blank">Pascale, Sternin and Sternin (2010)</a>.</p>
        <p class="lead">
          Albanna and Heeks (2018) have looked into the
          possibility of identifying positive deviants through the analysis of big data, e.g. identifying rice farmers
          through satellite imagery who manage to produce significantly higher yields than their peers. Solutions
          developed by Positive Deviants are so effective as they are locally developed, highly context-sensitive, and
          usually involve a great level of ownership by their communities. Regarding the huge challenges we are facing
          as local communities, we believe that the positive deviance approach has a great potential to help counties
          and municipalities in tackling the devastating consequences of the corona outbreak.
